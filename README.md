# hello-world
My first repository startup

Hi All

MeiyApp here, I like ISO standards built for the management system. Hence called as ISOMEIYAPP. I am a practioner of ISO 9001, 27001, 37001, 14001, 45001 & 18295-1&2. 
I do not know anything in coding now, this is my first step to start.
Need to start, learn and develop few projects in blockchain. Projects need to integrate the requirements of the ISO standard.
Hope someone will help somewhere
